GreenGrowth
GreenGrowth is a Python-based web application that leverages machine learning models to provide environmental predictions and support eco-friendly decision-making. The app offers a user-friendly web interface for interacting with predictive models trained on relevant datasets.

Features
Predictive Modeling: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes based on user input.

Web Application: Built with Flask to provide an interactive and responsive UI.

Training and Prediction Scripts: Separate Python scripts for training models (train.py) and making predictions (predict.py).

Static and Template Files: Organized front-end components for smooth user experience.

Tech Stack
Python 3.x

Flask (Web framework)

Machine Learning libraries (check requirements.txt for specifics)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend)
